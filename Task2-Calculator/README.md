# Task 2: Simple Calculator

This is a Python-based command-line calculator application that performs basic arithmetic operations. It is a part of the **CODSOFT** project tasks.

## Features
The calculator supports the following operations:
1. **Addition (`+`)**
2. **Subtraction (`-`)**
3. **Multiplication (`*`)**
4. **Division (`/`)**

### How It Works
- The user is prompted to input:
  1. Two numbers.
  2. An operation choice (`+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`).
- The application performs the selected operation and displays the result.
- Invalid inputs or operations are handled gracefully, with appropriate error messages.
